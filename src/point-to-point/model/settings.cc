	 * return true:
	 * L4 should solve dis-order of packet
	 * Receiver:
	 * 1. Reply to the corresponding ack directly after receiving the packet and set `m_received_psn.insert(curr_psn)`
	 * 2. The receiving end receives a packet marked with lasttag --> `received_last_psn_packet = true`
	 * 3. Every time a package is received, check if `m_received_last_psn_packet` and the previous packets are also received.
	 *    --> Send a lasttag ack to inform the sender that all packets have been received.
	 * Sender:
	 * 1. Send packets in order, `send_next += payload, m_sent_psn.insert(curr_psn)`
	 * 2. Received an ACK, ` m_sent psn.erase(curr_psn)`
	 * 3. The last PSN tag is sending, tag lasttag
	 * 4. Receiving the ack of lasttag tag indicates that the receiver has received it
	 * 5. Note that: for Go-Back-N that cannot be triggered by NACK, retransmission with timeout:
	 *    * `timeouted = true`
	 *    * If `send_nxt â‰  last_psn`, continue to send packets in sequence
	 *    * Otherwise, `m_timeout_psn = m_sent_psn', send packets which indicate by `m_timeout_psn`
